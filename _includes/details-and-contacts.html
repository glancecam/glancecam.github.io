					<p><b>Keep an eye on one or more IP cameras</b>:<br><br>
						‚Ä¢ Install <b>cameras from different manufacturers</b> and <b>avoid their cumbersome web interfaces, plugins or proprietary apps</b>.<br><br>
						‚Ä¢ Mount webcams in your living room, kitchen and garden to check on your cat when you're away, maybe turning on a light at night or taking a snapshot when kitty does something funny.<br><br>
						‚Ä¢ Point a camera at your front gate and let visitors in by activating a network relay.<br><br>
						<b>GlanceCam is a bit nerdy</b>, but very useful if you want to take full advantage of cheap webcams.<br>It can stream cameras on your LAN or via Internet and, while <b>it's not the most "works out-of-the-box" app to configure (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs#setup">you'll need some knowledge about your network and cameras</a>: IP address, username, password and the string format required to stream your specific camera model)</b>, it's very flexible and brand-agnostic; please, check the requirements section, and don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:support@cdf1982.com">ask me a question</a> before purchasing.<br><br>
						<b>Please be advised that GlanceCam is designed for realtime playback and DOES NOT support DVRs / NVRs, proprietary cloud services, recording (nor playback of recordings), motion detection and pan & tilt (PTZ) control</b>.<br><br><br><br>

					‚Ä¢ A Mac running Big Sur or a previous version of macOS (High Sierra or newer).<br><br>
					‚Ä¢ One or more IP cameras capable of broadcasting their stream via RTSP, HTTP(s) or RTMP; you'll need to know the camera IP address, your personal credentials (username and password) and the string format required by the manufacturer (including the string protocol and port). There's (<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs#setup">extensive documentation about the setup process</a>, and you can always <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs#support">count on my help</a> if you need assistance.<br><br>
					‚Ä¢ Any Mac running the supported operating systems should have plenty of power to stream IP cameras with GlanceCam, but multiple streams, high resolutions or lots of cameras open at the same time will require faster computers.<br><br>
					‚Ä¢ A solid connection between your computer and the cameras, be it LAN or WiFi, is recommended both for performances and stability, especially if you want many cameras to stream at the same time.<br><br>
					‚Ä¢ For triggering actions by pressing the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs#actions">customizable buttons</a>, you'll need devices or appliances that can react to HTTP GET requests.<br><br>
					‚Ä¢ To stream over the Internet, you'll need a static public IP address or a dynamic DNS service and to configure port forwarding for each camera and, optionally, action button; I recommend to start testing the video stream in LAN to check the compatibility before digging into remote connections; learn more <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs#remote">here</a>.<br><br><br>

						<b>Here's a list of <i>some</i> of the things GlanceCam can do:</b><br><br>
						‚Ä¢ With most IP webcams, you can <b>receive the video stream via RTSP, HTTP or RTMP</b>, without opening a browser; GlanceCam shows you those feeds in a <b>resizable window you can keep always visible on your Desktop</b>.<br><br>
						‚Ä¢ You can add <b>as many cameras as you like</b>.<br><br>
						‚Ä¢ The app shows one camera at a time in a single window, and you can switch between cameras inside that window; upgrading to GlanceCam Pro will allow to open as many windows as you need.<br><br>
						‚Ä¢ For every camera, you can also configure up to 2 optional buttons, visible when you hover your mouse on the app window, to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs#automation">perform actions via customizable HTTP GET request URLs.</a><br><br>
						‚Ä¢ GlanceCam's window can be configured to be <b>'Always on top' and visible in every Space</b>, or even 'Behind everything', at the level of your Desktop; the app can <b>optionally auto-launch at login</b>.<br><br>
						‚Ä¢ GlanceCam offers many <b><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs#shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a></b> and is great for automation: it has a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/faqs#automation">URL scheme and supports Apple Script</a> for switching cameras and toggling full-screen mode; you can even control it from your MacBook's TouchBar.<br><br><br><br>
