						GlanceCam 3 is the app's biggest update yet and the list of what is new and improved in the regular version is quite extensive. A few highlights:<br><br>
						• A <b>new Preferences window</b> makes easier adding, reordering and configuring video streams and tweaks; additional help is also provided in a new onboarding video, plus throughout the app in detailed tooltips and in the new, extensive FAQs.<br><br>
						• The <b>aspect ratio of the video stream is now auto-detected</b>.<br><br>
						• <b>Insta-zoom and resizing is faster</b>, more reliable and works great on ultra-wide displays.<br><br>
						• It's now possible to send a camera to the same level of macOS background, behind all apps and icons, so that it remains always available in the most unobtrusive way possible. A bit hacky and nerdy, but often asked for!<br><br>
						• Lots of <b>new keyboard shortcuts</b> have been added.<br><br>
						• Improved auto-generated email reports when requesting support or providing feedback.<br><br>
						• GlanceCam 3 rocks a <b>new, stunning app icon</b> designed by Becky Hansmeyer.

						<b>GlanceCam Pro is a new tier introduced in version 3 and is designed for Users with advanced requirements</b>, who have inspired and asked for its features.<br><br>It is available either as a yearly subscription at $ 8.99 or as a life-time in-app purchase at $ 22.99; both purchasing methods are available since some Users strongly prefer one option over the other, but they all unlock the same feature set:<br><br>
						• <b>Multi-windows support</b>, which allows to open, resize and arrange as many windows as needed, remembering their configuration between sessions.<br><br>
						• An optional <b>minimalistic user interface</b> that removes everything but the video stream when the app is not actively interacted with.<br><br>
						• The ability to <b>force a custom aspect-ratio</b>, for non standard streams such as horizontally compressed ones or vertical cameras.<br><br>
						• A <b>preferential channel for email support</b>, guaranteed in less than 24 hours, Monday through Friday.<br><br>
						• <b>14 funny and cute custom icons</b> to choose from, both in the new Big Sur style and in the "classic" round form (icon customisation is only shown in the Dock while GlanceCam is running).
