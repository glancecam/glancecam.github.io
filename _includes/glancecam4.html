						<b>GlanceCam 4 for Mac is a major release</b> and the list of features, new and improved, is <i>very</i> extensive. A few highlights:<br><br>
                        • Introducing <b>GlanceGrids</b>: presets of multiple cameras displayed in a single window with a flexible layout that automatically adjusts from a grid <i>(2x2, 3x3, etc.)</i> to a single row <i>(i.e. 8x1)</i> or column <i>(1x8)</i> based on the window's resizing; GlanceGrids are part of GlanceCam Pro and can work side by side with single-camera windows and USB-attached cameras.<br><br>
                        • Set an <b><i>Alternate Glance</i> for a camera to quickly switch between an HD and SD stream</b>, or between you two cameras you often toggle between —just press the A key!<br><br>
                        • With the new and unique <b>Roll Up</b> feature, view a video stream only when your mouse pointer enters the window area.<br><br>
                        • The <b>aspect ratio of the video stream is auto-detected</b> and the <b>ability to recover from network connections being disrupted</b> has increased significantly and is more customisable. And GlanceCam Pro Users with even the strangest and less standard-compliant cameras can find the right layout thanks to the new aspect ratio adjustments, <i>Freeform</i> and <i>Delayed</i>.<br><br>
                        • You can <b>protect your credentials</b> by customising the authentication requirements: if you share your Mac with others, you can decide to require your password, Touch ID or Apple Watch unlock before accessing your URLs in Settings.<br><br>
                        • With <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes#3_3">Out of my way</a></b>, the <i>magic trick</i> for moving a window temporarily to grab something below it and <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes#3_8">Stay out of my way</a></b>, you can achieve productivity bliss.<br><br>
						• Lots of <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs#shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a></b> give you superpowers.<br><br>
                        • The <b>improved Settings interface</b> makes it easier to add, reorder and configure video streams and tweaks; additional help is also provided in a the onboarding video, plus throughout the app in detailed tooltips and in the extensive <a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.<br><br>
                        • Getting human support is even quicker thanks to the improved auto-generated diagnostics report, now capable of automatically redact your credentials to safeguard your privacy even more.<br><br>
						• GlanceCam rocks a <b>stunning app icon</b> designed by <a href="https://beckyhansmeyer.com">Becky Hansmeyer</a>.<br><br><br>

                        <b>GlanceCam Pro is an optional upgrade and is designed for macOS Users with advanced requirements</b>, who have inspired and asked for its features.<br><br>It is offered <b>either as a yearly subscription</b> at $ 8.99 <b>or as a life-time in-app purchase</b> at $ 22.99; both purchasing methods are available since some Users strongly prefer one option over the other, but they all unlock the same feature set:<br><br>
						• <b>Multi-windows</b> support, which allows to open, resize and arrange as many windows as needed, remembering their layout between sessions. Independent windows are a convenient way to glance at different cameras throughout your day, by arranging them around your Desktop (and multiple displays) with different sizes... and with beloved GlanceCam features like <i>Insta-zoom</i> and <i>Out of my Way</i>, zooming-in to get a better look at a camera, or accessing another app or file below one of GlanceCam windows, is blazing fast!<br><br>
                        • <b>GlanceGrids</b>, the new grid system with presets that dinamically adapts the layout upon window resizing. New in GlanceCam 4, flexible grids are a companion or an alternative – your choice – to having multiple independent windows for your cameras are a great and highly customisable solution to never miss anything happening in your streams.<br><br>
                        • An optional <b>Minimalistic user interface</b> that removes everything but the video stream.<br><br>
                        • <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs#cyclemode">Cycle mode</a></b>: choose one of your windows and have it rotate some or all of your cameras according to a time interval you define.<br><br>
						• The ability to <b>force a custom aspect-ratio</b>, for non standard streams such as horizontally compressed ones or vertical cameras. GlanceCam is undoubtedly the best app for 180° panorama cameras and other non-16:9 devices.<br><br>
                        • Support for displaying internal and USB-attached cameras.<br><br>
						• A <b>preferential channel for email support</b>, guaranteed in less than 24 hours, Monday through Friday.<br><br>
						• <b>14 funny and cute custom icons</b> to choose from, both in the modern style and in the "classic" round form (icon customisation is only shown in the Dock while GlanceCam is running).
