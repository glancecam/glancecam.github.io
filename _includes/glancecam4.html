						<b>GlanceCam 4 is a major release</b> and the list of features, new and improved, is <i>very</i> extensive. A few highlights:<br><br>
                        • Introducing <b>GlanceGrids</b>: presets of multiple cameras displayed in a single window with a flexible layout that automatically adjusts from a grid <i>(2x2, 3x3, etc.)</i> to a single row <i>(i.e. 8x1)</i> or column <i>(1x8)</i> based on the window's resizing; GlanceGrids are part of GlanceCam Pro and can work side by side with single-camera windows and USB-attached cameras.<br><br>
                        • With the new and unique <b>Roll Up</b> feature, view a video stream only when your mouse pointer enters the window area and, as soon as you move your mouse away, have that camera "roll up" leaving only the title bar visible.<br><br>
                        • The <b>aspect ratio of the video stream is auto-detected</b> and the <b>ability to recover from network connections being disrupted</b> has increased significantly and is more customisable. And GlanceCam Pro Users with even the strangest and less standard-compliant cameras can find the right layout thanks to the new aspect ratio adjustments, <i>Freeform</i> and <i>Delayed</i>.<br><br>
                        • You can protect your credentials by customising the authentication requirements.<br><br>
                        • With <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes#3_3">Out of my way</a></b>, the <i>magic trick</i> for moving a window temporarily to grab something below it and <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes#3_8">Stay out of my way</a></b>, you can achieve productivity bliss.<br><br>
						• Lots of <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs#shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a></b> give you superpowers.<br><br>
                        • The <b>improved Settings interface</b> makes it easier to add, reorder and configure video streams and tweaks; additional help is also provided in a the onboarding video, plus throughout the app in detailed tooltips and in the extensive <a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.<br><br>
                        • Getting human support is even quicker thanks to the improved auto-generated diagnostics report, now capable of automatically redact your credentials to safeguard your privacy even more.<br><br>
						• GlanceCam rocks a <b>stunning app icon</b> designed by <a href="https://beckyhansmeyer.com">Becky Hansmeyer</a>.<br><br><br>
