						<b>GlanceCam 4 for Mac is a major release</b> and the list of features, new and improved, is <i>very</i> extensive. A few highlights:<br><br>
                        • Introducing <b>GlanceGrids</b>: presets of multiple cameras displayed in a single window with a flexible layout that automatically adjusts from a grid <i>(2x2, 3x3, etc.)</i> to a single row <i>(i.e. 8x1)</i> or column <i>(1x8)</i> based on the window's resizing; GlanceGrids are part of GlanceCam Pro and can work side by side with single-camera windows and USB-attached cameras.<br><br>
                        • With the new and unique <b>Roll Up</b> feature, view a video stream only when your mouse pointer enters the window area and, as soon as you move your mouse away, have that camera "roll up" leaving only the title bar visible.<br><br>
                        • The <b>aspect ratio of the video stream is auto-detected</b> and the <b>ability to recover from network connections being disrupted</b> has increased significantly and is more customisable. And GlanceCam Pro Users with even the strangest and less standard-compliant cameras can find the right layout thanks to the new aspect ratio adjustments, <i>Freeform</i> and <i>Delayed</i>.<br><br>
                        • You can <b>protect your credentials</b> by customising the authentication requirements: if you share your Mac with others, you can decide to require your password, Touch ID or Apple Watch unlock before accessing your URLs in Settings.<br><br>
                        • With <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes#3_3">Out of my way</a></b>, the <i>magic trick</i> for moving a window temporarily to grab something below it and <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/glancecam-release-notes#3_8">Stay out of my way</a></b>, you can achieve productivity bliss.<br><br>
						• Lots of <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs#shortcuts">keyboard shortcuts</a></b> give you superpowers.<br><br>
                        • The <b>improved Settings interface</b> makes it easier to add, reorder and configure video streams and tweaks; additional help is also provided in a the onboarding video, plus throughout the app in detailed tooltips and in the extensive <a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</a>.<br><br>
                        • Getting human support is even quicker thanks to the improved auto-generated diagnostics report, now capable of automatically redact your credentials to safeguard your privacy even more.<br><br>
						• GlanceCam rocks a <b>stunning app icon</b> designed by <a href="https://beckyhansmeyer.com">Becky Hansmeyer</a>.<br><br><br>

                        <b>GlanceCam Pro is an optional upgrade and is designed for macOS Users with advanced requirements</b>, who have inspired and asked for its features.<br><br>It is offered <b>either as a yearly subscription</b> at $ 8.99 <b>or as a life-time in-app purchase</b> at $ 22.99; both purchasing methods are available since some Users strongly prefer one option over the other, but they all unlock the same feature set:<br><br>
						• <b>Multi-windows</b> support, which allows to open, resize and arrange as many windows as needed, remembering their layout between sessions. Independent windows are a convenient way to glance at different cameras throughout your day, by arranging them around your Desktop (and multiple displays) with different sizes... and with beloved GlanceCam features like <i>Insta-zoom</i> and <i>Out of my Way</i>, zooming-in to get a better look at a camera, or accessing another app or file below one of GlanceCam windows, is blazing fast!<br><br>
                        • <b>GlanceGrids</b>, the new grid system with presets that dinamically adapts the layout upon window resizing. New in GlanceCam 4, flexible grids are a companion or an alternative – your choice – to having multiple independent windows for your cameras are a great and highly customisable solution to never miss anything happening in your streams.<br><br>
                        • An optional <b>Minimalistic user interface</b> that removes everything but the video stream.<br><br>
                        • <b><a href="https://cdf1982.com/glancecam/faqs#cyclemode">Cycle mode</a></b>: choose one of your windows and have it rotate some or all of your cameras according to a time interval you define.<br><br>
						• The ability to <b>force a custom aspect-ratio</b>, for non standard streams such as horizontally compressed ones or vertical cameras.<br><br>
                        • Support for displaying internal and USB-attached cameras.<br><br>
						• A <b>preferential channel for email support</b>, guaranteed in less than 24 hours, Monday through Friday.<br><br>
						• <b>14 funny and cute custom icons</b> to choose from, both in the modern style and in the "classic" round form (icon customisation is only shown in the Dock while GlanceCam is running).
