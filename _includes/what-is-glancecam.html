						<b>GlanceCam is an IP camera viewer for Mac.</b><br><br>As a native client with support for <b>standard streaming protocols</b>, it allows to keep an eye on cameras from different brands in a secure way and without dealing with multiple clunky web apps or obsolete applications.<br><br>Launched in the Mac App Store in March 2018 and priced at $ 3.99, GlanceCam is a convenient solution that offers lots of optional customisations for the video stream.<br><br>The app is <b>unobtrusive and easy to use</b>, but has advanced capabilities such as <b>Insta-zoom</b> (hold down the mouse right button to temporarily zoom) and <b>Always on top</b> (float the camera window above any other); it supports <b>4K and audio streams</b>, includes lots of <b>automation-friendly</b> features (keyboard shortcuts, the ability to send HTTP GET commands to IoT devices, support for Apple Script and a custom URL scheme) and more nerdy things.<br><br>
<b>Over 20 free updates</b> in 3 years and <b>attentive Users' support</b> built a loving audience, as proved by <b>more than 200 ratings in the App Store averaging 4+ stars</b>.<br><br><b>Version 3.0 will launch in mid-March 2021</b>, after two years of development, with lots of new features and improvements, some of them included in a new <b>GlanceCam Pro</b> optional tier.<br><br>GlanceCam is made with love by me, Cesare, a self-taught Mac and iOS developer based in Italy, but Milla's contribution figuring out the hard stuff while taking long walks cannot be discounted üê∫üèÉ.
