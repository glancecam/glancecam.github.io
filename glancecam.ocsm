      "title": "Important notice about GlanceCam on macOS Sequoia",
      "description": "Despite my continued efforts throughout the macOS 15 beta period, **some Users running Sequoia betas experience a serious compatibility issue with GlanceCam**: they reported that the app launches, but after a few seconds becomes unresponsive and requires to be force-quit.\n\nI am 100% focused on resolving the issue, but the hang appears to be the **consequence of a bug introduced by Apple in Sequoia that severely disrupts OpenGL** and  therefore the video engine GlanceCam relies upon, so a solution is not directly under my control.\n\nI have promptly reported the bug to Apple and to the open-source team that manages VLCKit, the video engine used by GlanceCam, but at the moment there isn't a solution yet.\n\n**If you rely on GlanceCam, my recommendation is NOT TO INSTALL SEQUOIA until I can report a solution has been found**; I appreciate the gravity of such recommendation, but despite trying everything I could, an issue so deep in the operating system stack can require time to be resolved by Apple and in the meantime I CANNOT PROMISE GLANCECAM WILL WORK reliably on Sequoia during this beta period or when Apple will officially release later this year.\n\nI am deeply sorry and focused on finding a solution; you can find **more informations at the link below**, and **I will send a new in-app message like this one when a solution is found and is safe to install Sequoia**. â€“Cesare",
